                <p class="quote">I've been an active member of Shaukk for well over 6 months now. I've found that it's a great discovery platform for hyperlocal events.Thanks to Shaukk, I've played countless games of football and availed of some incredible offers at places including Kick and Out of the Blue.

                    Local events can be a gnarly problem to crack. And this is exacerbated when events need to hit a tipping point for activation
(Eg. A minimum of 10 people for a game of football / A minimum of 10 people to activate a discount).

Aseem and his team have taken a hands-on, bottom-up approach to solving this problem, which I believe is the right way to do it. Even before they launched the platform, they've gotten their hands dirty and have been helping organize a host of events / tournaments / matches locally. And the insights they've developed are plain to see when you use Shaukk.

Shaukk has not only changed how we organize events, it's also resulted in a lot of us participating a lot more than we used to. Here's congratulating team Shaukk

                    Personally, I used Shaukk to set up guitar classes for people who would be interested in learning the instrument. At first, I wasn’t very sure if enough people would respond to the posts on the website, however, I was pleasantly surprised when quite a few calls came in inquiring about the classes.

Shaukk has helped me develop a decent platform for teaching guitar to some wonderful people. I recommend Shaukk for everyone who wants to create plans and share their events with like-minded people.
